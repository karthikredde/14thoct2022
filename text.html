<p class="pagani">Pagani took an interest in engineering while still living in Argentina. However, he felt from the beginning that the rural town in which he was born would not be adequate for the engineering career he dreamed of. He opened a small shop where he worked at a very young age, gaining valuable experience in craftsmanship. At the age of 20, Pagani had designed and built his first F3 racer.[1]

The turning point in Pagani's life came when he was hired by Renault to improve the body of a racing car. His work offered staggering improvements and Pagani was able to showcase his talent. After having success on this small scale, Pagani visited Lamborghini and met with the company's chief technical director Giulio Alfieri. In 1982, he decided to move to Italy and he was hired by Lamborghini. Pagani began working basic jobs such as sweeping the floor, however he was able to work his way up the company.[2]

He was a chief engineer at Lamborghini and he built the Countach Evoluzione concept. He tried to persuade Lamborghini to buy an autoclave so they could extend the production of the carbon parts for the Evoluzione. They refused, saying that Ferrari did not have an autoclave, so Lamborghini didn't need one. Pagani borrowed the capital to buy his own autoclave late in 1987 and then, in 1991, he broke away from the company and founded his own consultancy called Modena Design which continues to make carbon fiber composites for Formula One cars and clients like Daimler, Ferrari and Aprilia.[1][3]

Pagani Automobili Modena was founded by Pagani in 1992.[4] The first car he produced was the Zonda, which took seven years to complete,[1] followed by the Huayra, named after Huayra-tata, the god of the wind in Incan Culture..
Huayra BC

Pagani Huayra BC
An extreme, track-focused version of the Huayra called the Huayra BC was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The Huayra BC is named after the late Benny Caiola, a friend of Horacio Pagani, and the first Pagani customer. The Huayra BC has an improved version of the standard Huayra's engine, producing 764 PS (562 kW; 754 hp) and 1,000 N⋅m (740 lb⋅ft) of torque.[11] The weight is reduced by 132 kg (291 lb) to just 1,218 kg (2,685 lb), thanks to the use of an all-new material called 'carbon-triax' in the car which Pagani claims is 50% lighter and 20% stronger than regular carbon fibre, giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 1.62 kg (3.57 lb) per horsepower. The Huayra BC uses a lightweight titanium exhaust system, new aluminum alloy wheels, and a stripped-out interior. The tyres are Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tires that feature 12 different rubber compounds, and the suspension and wishbones are made of aeronautical grade aluminum, known as Avional. The Huayra BC also has a new front bumper with a front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an air diffuser that stretches the entire width of the rear bumper along with a large rear wing. The car uses an Xtrac 7-speed sequential manual transmission and has an electro-hydraulic actuation system. Pagani has stuck with a single-clutch gearbox because it weighs 40% less than double-clutch gearboxes.

Only 20 units of the Huayra BC were made, all of which were already sold with each unit costing €2.1M.[12][13]

Huayra Roadster
After 2 years of development, the Huayra Roadster was officially unveiled in the 2017 Geneva Motor Show.[14]

The design of the car underwent several changes, with the most noticeable being the rear, with updated eyelid-like fixed flaps that continued with the design and eventually ended on the rear lights. Vents were included on the rear engine cover for efficient cooling of the engine, and the wheels were updated specifically for the car along with Pirelli P-Zero tires, along with the addition of a spoiler at the front. The car has conventional doors instead of the Gull-wing doors used in the coupé as such doors cannot be fitted to an open top car. The car has the same twin-turbo V12 engine as the coupé but with the power upgraded to 764 PS (562 kW; 754 hp) at 6,200 rpm and 1,000 N⋅m (740 lb⋅ft) of torque at 2,400 rpm. The power is delivered to the rear wheels via a Xtrac 7-speed sequential manual transmission which is 40% lighter than its coupé counterpart. The car was constructed by a material developed by Pagani called 'carbon triax', which is a combination of tri-axis fibre glass with carbon fibre. This allowed the car to weigh 70 kg (154 lb) less than its coupé counterpart, for a total of 1,280 kg (2,820 lb), making it the first roadster lighter than the coupé. Only 100 were made, all of which were sold even before production ended.Pagani said that the car could accelerate at 1.8 G.
